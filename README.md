### Project Motivation
This project is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program as 'Write a Data Science Blog Post'.

I chose to study AirBnB's New York City dataset for this project as I went to college there and found it an interesting topic.
The dataset describes the listings of 'stays', homes/apartments/private rooms/shared rooms on the AirBnB platform.
It contains over 36,000 individual 'stays' with 16 column variables describing each location.
The link to the original dataset is here http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

The project was concerned with the following questions:
1. What are the price differences between New York's 5 boroughs on AirBnB?
2. What are the differences in demand and price between the 4 room types?
3. What impact does the # of listings a host is managing have on their 'stays' demand?

### Libraries

Libraries used:
- Pandas
